# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
Go to the Windows 11 download page.
Follow the instructions to download the Windows 11 installation media.
Create a bootable USB drive or upgrade directly if your current OS supports it.
Follow the installation prompts to install Windows 11 on your machine
2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/DownloadGo to the Visual Studio Code download page.
Choose the version suitable for Windows and download the installer.
Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com
Visit GitHub and sign up for a new account if you don't already have one.
Initialize a Git Repository:

Open a terminal or Git Bash.
Navigate to your project directory.
Run the following commands to initialize a Git repository and make your first commit:

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.
Download Python from the official Python website.
Run the installer and ensure you check the box to add Python to your PATH.
Verify the installation by opening a terminal and running

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).
Install pip for Python: S python -m pip install
Pip should be installed with Python. Verify by running
S python pip --version

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
Go to the MySQL download page.
Download the MySQL Installer for Windows.
Run the installer and follow the setup instructions, choosing the appropriate setup type (e.g., Developer Default).
Configure your MySQL instance with the setup wizard
#Struggled, due to constantly installing x32 bit in a x64 bit system but with "Uncle" i was able to prompt correct instructions

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.
#Did not excersice that option 
8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.
Open Visual Studio Code.
Go to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
Search for and install the following recommended extensions:
Python (by Microsoft)
GitLens (supercharges the Git capabilities built into VS Code)
Prettier - Code formatter
MySQL (for database management)

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them. 
  Even though there were a step-by-step tutorials and documentation, i did encounter certain challenges with installing MySQL but that was partly due to overlooking a minor installation error.  I have been able to familiarize myself with installed applications and able to navigate most of them without trouble. Following the source material ensures efficiency and better understanding of how the installed applications function, it also outlines the usability aspect of the apps installed.    

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
